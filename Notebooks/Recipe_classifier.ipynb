calories. Cucumbers also contain potassium, iron, zinc, fluorine, and some vitamin C. With the goat's cheese comes satiating protein between the slices.   \n","1      The sulfur substances contained in chives are responsible for their slight pungency. They provide a slight antibacterial effect and have a positive effect on digestion. If things run smoothly in the intestines, our concentration is also ensured. This is also supported by the omega-3 fatty acids from the smoked salmon trout.   \n","2                                                                       Do you have a sensitive stomach? Then tofu is perfect for you, because it's easy on the stomach and doesn't put a strain on digestion. Great veggie option: With around 15 percent vegetable protein, soy cheese gives us about as much as most types of meat offer.   \n","3                            Despite the fruity-sweet taste of Watermelons there is relatively little sugar in it. On top, the fruit provides plenty of liquid for a refreshing feast on hot summer days. Essential oils from Cress help to get disease-causing bacteria under control. For example, cold symptoms can subside more quickly.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                Eggs contain a lot of biotin.

Cucumbers also contain potassium, iron, zinc, fluorine, and some vitamin C. With the goat's cheese comes satiating protein between the slices.   \n","1  The sulfur substances contained in chives are responsible for their slight pungency.

Then tofu is perfect for you, because it's easy on the stomach and doesn't put a strain on digestion. Great veggie option: With around 15 percent vegetable protein, soy cheese gives us about as much as most types of meat offer.   \n","3                        Despite the fruity-sweet taste of Watermelons there is relatively little sugar in it.
